# Youtube-Screenshot
A simple firefox add-on to take a screenshot of a playing youtube video on pressing **shift + A**

## Trying it out
In Firefox: Open the about:debugging page, click "This Firefox" (in newer versions of Firefox), click "Load Temporary Add-on", then select any file in the extension's directory.
The extension will now be installed, and will stay until you restart Firefox.
Now open youtube.com, play a video then press **shift + A** to save a video frame as an image.

_To keep the extension permanently, add script to greasemonkey._
